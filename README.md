What is IAbox?
--------------
The Interference Alignment MATLAB/Octave Toolbox (IAbox) is a set of 
MATLAB/Octave functions implementing results and algorithms that have 
emerged from studies on the interference aligment (IA) idea and other
related literature.

Other useful functionalities, not necessarily from the IA literature, but 
from the wireless communications world, have also been implemented.

This is a work in progress. It may (and will) contain errors, bugs, misconceptions and even some working stuff.
Critics, bug reports, collaborations and any sort of feedback is welcome.

Naming / style conventions
--------------------------
The code in this toolbox tries to stick to the MATLAB Programming Style 
Guide Wiki that can be found at
