It may (and will) contain errors, bugs, misconceptions and even some working stuff.\r\nCritics, bug reports, collaborations and any sort of feedback is welcome.\r\n\r\nImplemented Algorithms\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n[Listed by publication date](src/Algorithms/README.md)\r\n\r\nImplemented DoF / Feasibility Results\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\r\n[Listed by publication date](src/DoFandFeasibility/README.md)\r\n\r\nNaming / style conventions\r\n--------------------------\r\nThe code in this toolbox tries to stick to the MATLAB Programming Style \r\nGuide Wiki that can be found at\r\n[https://sites.google.com/site/matlabstyleguidelines/home][1]\r\n\r\nInput arguments to algorithms/functions are passed in the following order\r\n\r\n`nT,nR,H,U,V,D,W`\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n------------\r\n\r\nList of people who have contributed to this toolbox:\r\n\r\n - Óscar González\r\n - Christian Lameiro\r\n - Jacobo Fanjul\r\n \r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nThis repository is maintained by [Óscar González][2].
